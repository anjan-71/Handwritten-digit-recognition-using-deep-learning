 Handwritten digit recognition using deep learning
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of artificial intelligence and is often used as a benchmark for testing the capabilities of machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The goal of handwritten digit recognition is to correctly classify images of handwritten digits (typically from 0 to 9) into their corresponding numeric representations.
